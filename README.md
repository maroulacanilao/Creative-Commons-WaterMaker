# Creative-Commons-WaterMaker

The **Creative Commons WaterMaker** is a Python script that allows you to add Creative Commons (CC) license watermarks to your images. Whether you're sharing photos, artwork, or other visual content, this tool helps protect your work by clearly indicating the license terms.

2. Install the required dependencies (PIL library for image processing).
3. Place your images in the `Input` folder.
4. Run the script.
5. The watermarked images will be saved in the `Output` folder.
